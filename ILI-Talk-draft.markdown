Your Library Website Stinks and it's Your Fault

Library websites stink. They are bloated, overly-complicated messes we force between our patrons, our collections, and ourselves. Very few library websites were designed to be used by people. 

Slides of twitter complaints about library websites.

But, you're saying, we don't have the budget for a fancy website. We don't have a web designer. We don't have the skills to make things better. 

Alan Cooper: "There is little difference technically between a complicated, confusing program and a simple, fun, and powerful product. The difference is one of culture, training, and attitude of the people who make them." (The Inmates are Running the Asylum)

This is a talk about library websites, but it's really a talk about people. It's a talk about our library members, a talk about us, and what's wrong with the way we're doing things, and how it's hurting our members.

In 1939, Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett started a small company making test equipment in a garage in Palo Alto, California. Dave and Bill were electrical engineers who wanted better equipment for other engineers. Hewlett Packard began by making test equipment, that is, tools designed by experts for experts. Their first motto was "Design for the person at the next bench" (c.f. Norman, Donald. (2004). Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. New York: Basic Books. p.83) And this mindset worked really well for them as long as they were building for other electrical engineers. But once their market changed, and they started targeting consumers, they adapted. They stopped building tools for experts, and started building tools for everyday people.

The story of library catalogs is a little bit like this. In the 1960s, the MARC format allowed us to put catalog records in computers, which were easier to search than phsyical card catalogs. By the late 1970s and '80s, these catalogs were being networked so that librarians could do searches on behalf of patrons. Again, these were complicated tools built by experts, for experts. But in the '90s, we opened up our catalogs to the public. You no longer had to go through a librarian to search the online catalog. 

The problem, though, was that we didn't adapt the tools to the new audience. The tools were still built for experts, but we let anyone with a modem use them. Since then we've made a little progress, but not much. I still see advanced search, like this one, as the default page on many library databases. In usability tests, students at our university had physical reactions to seeing the Lexis Nexis homepage.  And these are not people who know nothing about technology. These are kids who admit to using the web 6, 8, 12 hours a *day*, on their laptops, tablets, and phones.

Maya Angelu: "People will forget what you said, and what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel"

We make our patrons *feel* like beginners. We make them feel stupid at a critical moment when they are vunerable. They are at the library because they admit to themselves that they don't know something. By making it hard for them to find the information they need, we over-emphasize their deficiency.

We've built our online tools around the idea that we should *tell* them how the tool works, rather than *listening* to what they need.

It might help to think about our options here. Jared Spool, a usability expert, likes to explain this difficulty with help from the "Magical Escalator of Aquired Knowledge."

Very few people can be considered absolute novices at using technology, and very few people are complete experts. Most of us fall somewhere on the magic escalator between novice and expert, depending on our current knowledge. 

Now, each website requires a certain about of knowledge to use properly. Spool calls this the "Target knowledge." Now, if our current knowledge matches or exceeds the target knowledge, we have no problem using the site. Problems arise when our current knowledge is below the target knowledge.

Here we have two options: get the user's current knowledge up to the target knowledge (through training), or bring the target knowledge down to meet the user's current knowledge. Most library websites rely on training. In my library, that means academic librarians with subject expertise spend time in front of classrooms pointing to links and saying "Click Here" or walking students step-by-step through finding information for a research paper.

Has anyone ever been through step-by-step training to use Google?

Sure, it's easy to use. We librarians like to poo-poo Google precisely because it *is* easy, because we associate ease-of-use with lack of power. But the reason people use Google isn't necessarily because it's easy. Google is easy to use because they want their users to feel good about themselves when they use it.

Now, because Google has a really good reason to make people feel good: profits. The more people that use Google, the more eyeballs they can sell to advertisers. And people like to feel good. No one wants to use a product that made them feel like an idiot.

So, does that mean that making our library websites simple is the only path?  To copy Google? [Slide of http://twitter.com/samplereality/status/225592628824113153] Get target knowledge down to the current knowledge of our users? It helps, sure, but it's not the only option. Simplifying our websites doesn't have to mean removing powerful features like advanced search or Boolean operators.  We don't have to remove every bit of friction. [Slide of http://twitter.com/Cennydd/status/185343407479209984] But it does mean thinking differntly about our roles as librarians and about what we are doing when we design websites.

I love GScholar. It does academic search better than any other tools. But we _could_ do that, if we didn't cede the ground. http://twitter.com/CopyrightLibn/status/187302329169620995
