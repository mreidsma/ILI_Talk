Your Library Website Stinks and it's Your Fault

Library websites stink. They are bloated, overly-complicated messes we force between our patrons, our collections, and ourselves. Very few library websites were designed to be used by people. 

Slides of twitter complaints about library websites.

Maya Angelu: "People will forget what you said, and what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel"

But, you're saying, we don't have the budget for a fancy website. We don't have a web designer. We don't have the skills to make things better.

Really?

Alan Cooper: "There is little difference technically between a complicated, confusing program and a simple, fun, and powerful product. The difference is one of culture, training, and attitude of the people who make them." (The Inmates are Running the Asylum)

This is a talk about library websites, but it's really a talk about people. It's a talk about our library members, a talk about us, and what's wrong with the way we're doing things, and how it's hurting our members.

In 1939, Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett started a small company making test equipment in a garage in Palo Alto, California. Dave and Bill were electrical engineers who wanted better equipment for other engineers. Hewlett Packard began by making test equipment, that is, tools designed by experts for experts. Their first motto was "Design for the person at the next bench" (c.f. Norman, Donald. (2004). Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. New York: Basic Books. p.83) And this mindset worked really well for them as long as they were building for other electrical engineers. But once their market changed, and they started targeting consumers, they adapted. They stopped building tools for experts, and started building tools for everyday people.

The story of library catalogs is a little bit like this.

We've built a tool for experts, and turned it loose on the unsuspecting public. And now we've got to figure out how to get these novice users up to speed on how to use our complicated tools.

It might help to think about our options here. Jared Spool, a usability expert, likes to explain this difficulty with help from the "Magical Escalator of Aquired Knowledge."

Very few people can be considered absolute novices at using technology, and very few people are complete experts. Most of us fall somewhere on the magic escalator between novice and expert, depending on our current knowledge. 

Now, each website requires a certain about of knowledge to use properly. Spool calls this the "Target knowledge." Now, if our current knowledge matches or exceeds the target knowledge, we have no problem using the site. Problems arise when our current knowledge is below the target knowledge.

Here we have two options: get the user's current knowledge up to the target knowledge (through training), or bring the target knowledge down to meet the user's current knowledge.
