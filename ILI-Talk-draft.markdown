Your Library Website Stinks and it's Your Fault

Library websites stink. They are difficult to use and create tension between us and our patrons. 

[Slides of twitter complaints about library websites.]

But, you're saying, we don't have the budget for a fancy website. We don't have a web designer. We don't have the skills to make things better. 

[Slide of Quote] Alan Cooper: "There is little difference technically between a complicated, confusing program and a simple, fun, and powerful product. The difference is one of culture, training, and attitude of the people who make them." (The Inmates are Running the Asylum)

This is a talk about library websites, but it's really a talk about people. It's a talk about our library patrons, a talk about us, what's wrong with the way we're doing things, and how and who it hurts.

In 1939, Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett started a small company making test equipment in a garage in Palo Alto, California. Dave and Bill were electrical engineers who wanted better equipment for other engineers. Hewlett Packard began by making test equipment, that is, tools designed by experts for experts. Their first motto was "Design for the person at the next bench" (c.f. Norman, Donald. (2004). Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. New York: Basic Books. p.83) And this mindset worked really well for them as long as they were building for other electrical engineers. But once their market changed, and they started targeting consumers, they adapted. They stopped building tools for experts, and started building tools for everyday people.

The story of library catalogs is a little bit like this. In the 1960s, the MARC format allowed us to put catalog records in computers, which were easier to search than phsyical card catalogs. By the late 1970s and '80s, these catalogs were being networked so that librarians could do searches on behalf of patrons. Again, these were complicated tools built by experts, for experts. The question that guided us through all of this was "How do librarians do this?"

In the '90s, we opened up our catalogs to the public. You no longer had to go through a librarian to search the online catalog.

The problem, though, was that we didn't ask any new questions. The question that guided the development of these tools was still "How do librarians  do this?" The tools were still built for experts, but we let anyone with a modem use them. 

But we started to notice something: non-librarians were having trouble using our search tools. After 1998 and the rise of Google, the problem got worse. So we started giving workshops and teaching people how to search on our websites.

But this wasn't our only option. Jared Spool, a usability expert, likes to explain this dillema with help from the "Magical Escalator of Aquired Knowledge." [Slide of magical escalator with Novice and Expert]

Most of us fall somewhere on the magic escalator between novice and expert, depending on our current knowledge. [Slide with Current Knowledge]

Every website requires some knowledge. Spool calls this the "Target knowledge." [Slide with Target Knowledge] Now, if our current knowledge matches or exceeds the target knowledge, we have no problem using the site. Problems arise when our current knowledge is below target knowledge.

We have two options: get the user's current knowledge up to the target knowledge (through training), or bring the target knowledge down to meet the user's current knowledge. We picked training. In my library, that means academic librarians with subject expertise spend time in front of classrooms pointing to links and saying "Click Here" or walking students step-by-step through finding information for a research paper.

This whole way of thinking only makes sense when you start with the question "How do librarians do this?" If we asked a different question, we'd probably have different results.

Some libraries have started asking a new question: "How do our users do this?" They went the other way with the magical escalator, and simplified their sites so they didn't require quite so much target knowledge. They still pack a lot of power, but they are easier to use.

In the past few months, several libraries have launched major redesigns that show user-centered design principles at work.

When you start with this question, "How do our users do this?" you put people at the center of your thinking about your tool. But what or who are these 'people?' 

Frank Chimero on information

This is progress, but it is not enough. When people come to into our physical libraries and walk up to the circulation desk, they are not mere information. They are not embodied behavioral patterns. They are people, with thoughts and emotions and contradictions. Since more people visit our websites than our desks, why shouldn't they be treated as well?

It's time for another question.

Maya Angelu: "People will forget what you said, and what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel"

Our websites make our patrons *feel* like beginners. We make them feel stupid at a critical moment when they are vunerable. They are at the library because they admit to themselves that they don't know something. By making it hard for them to find the information they need, we over-emphasize their deficiency.

The question we should be asking before we build library websites is "How do we want people to feel?"

Fred Meijer, the founder of the largest grocery store chain in my home state of Michigan, used to carry a small notebook in his pocket. Whenever he met anyone new, from another CEO to a brand-new bagboy at one of his stores, he took a moment to write down their name and some things he had learned about them: their families, where they live, what schools their children go to, the things he and they have in common or disagree about.

Every night, he would go through that notebook and memorize those details about the people he had met. He did this because he firmly believed that everyone was important, and he wanted to make people feel that way. Even the seemingly small act of remembering a name made a huge impact on the people that met him.

“If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person.”

We can learn from lessons like this. We cant make every visit to our websites perfect. We can't make some vendor interfaces better and we also cant live without them. But it just takes a different starting question to make progress here. Is we focus on how we want our users to feel, we're going to help them do the things they need to do. But we'll do it in a compassionate way. Maybe the things we do differently are small things, but that might be all we need.
