Start with quote from Alan Cooper - library culture gets in the way
Why? a lot of reasons - lack of technical ability, training, etc. BUT - changing role of librarian is key
Jared Spool - magical escalator of aquired knowledge
See tension between simplifying interface and training users
librarians see their role as training - afraid to give that up
but there are differentkids of training - no one should have to be taught where to click - save librarian training for larger issues, processes
make the interface teach people how to use it
(Clippy) - not like that
How do we do this? Game designers have been doing this for years
Miyamoto interview on SMB
How do we transfer this knowledge to the web
Mindset: "No matter what they do, they get the mushroom." - how do we make our tools so that no matter what our users do, they get what they want?
Takes planning, forethought

Library websites stink. They are bloated, overly-complicated messes we force between our members, our collections, and ourselves. Very few library websites were designed to be used by people.

But, you're saying, we don't have the budget for a fancy website. We don't have a web designer. We don't have the skills to make things better.

Really?

Alan Cooper: "There is little difference technically between a complicated, confusing program and a simple, fun, and powerful product. The difference is one of culture, training, and attitude of the people who make them." (The Inmates are Running the Asylum)

This is a talk about library websites, but it's really a talk about people. It's a talk about our library members, a talk about us, and what's wrong with the way we're doing things, and how it's hurting our members.

We've built a tool for experts, and turned it loose on the unsuspecting public. And now we've got to figure out how to get these novice users up to speed on how to use our complicated tools.

It might help to think about our options here. Jared Spool, a usability expert, likes to explain this difficulty with help from the "Magical Escalator of Aquired Knowledge."

Very few people can be considered absolute novices at using technology, and very few people are complete experts. Most of us fall somewhere on the magic escalator between novice and expert, depending on our current knowledge. 

Now, each website requires a certain about of knowledge to use properly. Spool calls this the "Target knowledge." Now, if our current knowledge matches or exceeds the target knowledge, we have no problem using the site. Problems arise when our current knowledge is below the target knowledge.

Here we have two options: get the user's current knowledge up to the target knowledge (through training), or bring the target knowledge down to meet the user's current knowledge.
